server.js

npm install -> npm start -> server online
This script starts with npm start -command.

Row 4 -> Folder app is declared as an express -server.
Row 10 -> Enable CORS, it eases up the usage of databases with express.
Cors listens for HTTP requests by port 8081.

Rows 24-27 -> We enable the http-routes on the server, which the controllers will use.
Row 30 -> Set the listening port as 8080.



/app/

/config/dbConfig.js

Exported stock connection to database, user/password is root



/controllers/

HTTP request -controllers for each database table.
Each export -function will send information to related table model in /models/,
if it needs information. getAll() -function works with or without parameters,
if you decide to put parameters in the http request it will return related entries from the table.
If you decide to call it with a null -parameter (no parameters), it will return everything
the related table.



/models/

Functions to use the database. Controller will process a HTTP request and send it to it's related model.
For an example customerController.js -> Exports.create(controller) -> Customer.create(model)
-> "INSERT INTO Customer SET ?". The ? will be replaced with the parameter we've been given by the controller.
The parameter is usually a JSON-object, which the .query -function will parse and insert/select from the database.

db.js

Database connection script. This uses the earlier declared stock connection to the database,
and exports it to each model so they are connected to the database too.



/routes/

Controller will get the information on what to do by these routes.
If the route type is router.post, we'll go to the related model's INSERT -function,
router.get will og to the SELECT -function etc.

Most of these work so far by index, which means that if we are in
localhost:8080/customers, the URL does not need to change.
We only send a get/post request, which will return related entries from the database.



/node_modules/

This folder is irrelevant for our usage.
The folder is created with the npm install -command, and it automatically installs all the modules and files it needs to work.
This is in .gitignore because it takes space from our github root folder, so it is always installed locally before the server can be set up.
